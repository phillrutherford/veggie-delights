Welcome phillrutherford,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Gitpod and the extensions we use.

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

## Updates Since The Instructional Video

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

Happy coding!


# Veggie Delights

My data centric development project is called Veggie Delights. I am creating an app fro vegeterian meals, recipes and cooking methods. 
Users will be able to add, edit and delete meals. My goal for this app is to simply offer users creative alternative vegetarian meals whilst allowing
them to share their ideas and creations with others.

## UX

* I wanted to keep the layout design and colour scheme simple for this project. I didnt want to overwhelm the user so i stuck with the white background with dark green boxes. 
This helped me keep everything very clear and readable for all users. The layout makes it a very easy to use application allowing all users to view the meals on offer, quickly 
access all recipes and methods and of course sharing their own meals efficiently. 
I used the Langar font for this project. I felt it was a unique font that still kept things simple and clearly readable. 

* All of the meals submitted will be viewed on the initial homepage. From here the user will be able to access each meal with quick dropdown showing the recipes and cooking methods.
Next to each meal will be an edit and delete button clearly outlined in its own colour. Underneath all of the meals will be the "Add your meal" feature which will direct the users to a form
where they will be asked to fill out the meal name, ingredients and instructions. From there they will submit the meal and it will appear at the bottom of the list on the homepage.

* The main target audience is of course vegetarians, however this app is not strictly focused on that group. In this generation we are finding a lot more people are experimenting with vegetarian
and vegan meals on ocassion. This app will offer those people an insight into some of the options available to them to be creative with their cooking methods and maybe add some variety into their diets.

* For this project I wanted to ensure that the user felt the app was very simple to navigate, this was my top priority and I believe that shows in the final product. I did think about adding accounts, 
making adding/editing/deleting meals a function only members who were logged in could use. I chose not to do this on this ocassion but its certainly something that i would consider adding if I were 
to do this again. 

## Features

For this project I used materialize quite often. They have alot of good features and colour schemes on offer that really allow you to be creative.

1. The collapsible feature is a huge part of this application. Each meal has a dropdown feature that shows the Ingredients and Instructions. I did this to reduce clutter on the page and keep it 
presentable. 

2. I also used the card feature from materialize for my "Add your meal" page. This allowed to have a clear layout form for users to fill out the information required to add their
meal to the site.

3. The edit and delete buttons were used to give the user flexibility. This allows them to change any errors or typing mistakes they may have made when adding a meal.

Other features I would have liked to introduce would ##########################

## Technologies used

For this project I used several different technologies.
* jQuery
    I chose to use jQuery for this project because I felt this simplified javascript I was implementing.

* Font Awesome
    I used font awesome to assist me in adding icons into the site to improve presentation.

* Materialize
    As I discussed previously Materialize has been hugely effective in enabling me to use several features to ensure the site is easy to use the information is laid out in a clear and concise way.

* Google Fonts
    Google Fonts is a useful tool to change the fonts throughout the project.
